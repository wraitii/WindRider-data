	"description": "The aiming variant of the M&M Medium Blaster is the most common weapon in the galaxy... Or so says their marketing team. For sure, it works well. With 6 degrees of rotation in every axis, it makes it much easier to hit the target, and what's not to love about that?\nObviously the price is ridiculously higher, and there's a higher energy spending, but when it can mean the difference between life and death, does it truly matter?",
