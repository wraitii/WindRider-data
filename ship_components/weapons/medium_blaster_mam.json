	"description": "This medium blaster from Mark and Mark is among the more serviceable weapons in the known galaxy. It won't fail, it won't crash, it will pack a punch. There are three variants of it, a fixed version which is rather rare, an aiming version that you can find on most any ship these days, and the fully turreted version for traders who care.",
